# CV
Documents for updating and generating my cv, as seen on [my academic website](https://fredner.org).

cv.pdf is the full cv. cv_2 is a 2 page version of the same, which is updated less regularly.

I build this on my Mac using the following pandoc command:

```
pandoc cv.md -o cv.pdf
```

Requires both [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and a full [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) installation.
