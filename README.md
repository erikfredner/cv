# CV
Documents for updating and generating my cv, as seen on [my website](https://fredner.org).

`cv.pdf` shows what the full typeset cv looks like.

I build this using the following command:

```bash
pandoc cv.md -o cv.pdf
```

Requires both [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and a full [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) installation.
