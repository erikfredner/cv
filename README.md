# CV

See the typeset CV on [my website](https://fredner.org/files/cv.pdf).

## Process

Originally, I wrote the CV in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), then converted it to a `TeX` file using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

I manually update the `TeX` file using TeXShop via [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
